## Purpose
---
This repository shares practice for different data preparation use cases and tasks based on the community's initiative challenge called [**"Preppin' Data"**](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) . 

Each sub-folder is named after its corresponding week number, and each one of them contains a solution for the weekly challenge.
<br/><br/>

For the majority of the solutions, two options can be found:

- Using Tableau Prep
- Using Python, primarily utilizing the [Polars module](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/index.html).
<br/><br/>

> Note: A few of the Tableau Prep solutions are not fully complete due to issues or bugs. These issues may be resolved in future releases of the tool, which prevented me from completing the solutions.
